Problem Identification: In both projects, the primary task revolves around managing course data within a Computer Science program.
Project One focuses on outlining pseudocode for manipulating and organizing this data using different data structures (vectors, hash tables, trees) 
while emphasizing runtime analysis. Project Two involves loading course data from a file, organizing it into a structure, and implementing a menu-driven interface 
to interact with and display the course information.

Approach and Importance of Data Structures:
The approach in both projects revolves around employing various data 
structures such as vectors, hash tables, and trees to efficiently manage 
and manipulate course information. Understanding data structures is crucial; 
they act as the backbone of software, influencing its performance, scalability, and organization. 
Choosing the appropriate structure can significantly impact how efficiently operations are performed on the data.

Overcoming Roadblocks:
While working through the projects, 
understanding the intricacies of different data structures might
have posed a challenge. To overcome this, breaking down the problem into smaller 
components, practicing pseudocode, and gradually implementing the logic into code could have helped 
in comprehending the nuances of each structure's usage and functionality.

Expanding Approach to Designing Software:
These projects likely expanded the understanding of designing software 
by emphasizing the importance of data organization and manipulation. 
Learning to choose the right data structure for specific tasks lays a
strong foundation for designing efficient and scalable software systems.

Evolving Program Writing Practices:
Working on these projects might 
have emphasized the significance of writing maintainable,
readable, and adaptable code. Implementing modular code, 
adhering to naming conventions, and incorporating comments/documentation
for clarity not only enhance code readability but also facilitate future maintenance and updates.
